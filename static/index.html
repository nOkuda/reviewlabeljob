      <p id="document" class="jumbotron">You will see 10 product reviews.  Your
      task is to click on the number of stars you think the reviewer gave for
      each of these reviews.  We are measuring both your speed and accuracy.  We
      believe it will take, on average, about 30 seconds per review.<br><br>

      After clicking on the number of stars you think the reviewer gave, you
      will be shown the correct answer.  In this case, click on the "Continue"
      button to continue with your task.<br><br>

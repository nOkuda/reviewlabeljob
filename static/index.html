      This user study is being conducted by the Applied Machine Learning
      Laboratory, Department of Computer Science, Brigham Young
      University.<br><br>

      You will see 20 product reviews.  Your task is to click on the number of
      stars you think the reviewer gave for each of these reviews.  We are
      measuring both your speed and accuracy.  We believe it will take, on
      average, about 10 minutes to complete this task.<br><br>

      After clicking on the number of stars you think the reviewer gave, you
      will be shown the correct answer.  Click on the "Continue" button to
      continue with your task.<br><br>

      Your work will be immediately approved for compensation if it does not
      exceed a certain error threshold.  If the threshold is exceeded, the work
      will be automatically rejected.<br><br>

      You may do this task only once.<br><br>

      Do not press the back or forward button on your web browser.  If you are
      not using Chrome or Firefox, we cannot guarantee that this user study will
      work properly, including compensation for your work.<br><br>

      Click the "Ready" button when you are ready to begin.</p>

      This user study is being conducted by the Applied Machine Learning
      Laboratory, Department of Computer Science, Brigham Young
      University.<br><br>

      You will see 80 product reviews.  Your task is to click on the number of
      stars you think the reviewer gave for each of these reviews.  The star
      rating system is on a scale from one to five, where one star signifies a
      very negative review and five stars signifies a very positive review.  We
      are measuring both your speed and accuracy.  We believe it will take, on
      average, about 40 minutes to complete this task.<br><br>

      After clicking on the number of stars you think the reviewer gave, you
      will be shown the correct answer.  Click on the "Continue" button to
      continue with your task.<br><br>

      At the top of the page, we will show you how many product reviews you have
      completed, what your average error is, and the percentage of star ratings
      you have chosen correctly.  You want to keep your average error as low as
      possible, which you can do by choosing the star rating that is closest to
      the one the reviewer gave.  Consequently, doing this will also increase
      your percentage.<br><br>

      You may participate in this user study only once.<br><br>
